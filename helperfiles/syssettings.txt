# An command line to create .po -file for individual module. Xgettext.pl is an perl-script
# which can be found from http://search.cpan.org/~drtech/Locale-Maketext-Lexicon-0.77/script/xgettext.pl
#
# Note, that xgettext.pl is totally another project than xgettext from 'gettext' -Debian package.
# This file can't be used directly and I'll replace this one with actually working script for easier
# management of .po -files later. So consider this merely as an hint about how to create .po files than
# actual script, manual or anything more than just an single command line.

~/bin/xgettext.pl -o tmp/syssettings.po templates/modules/systemsettings/* templates/systemsettings goah/Modules/Systemsettings.pm
