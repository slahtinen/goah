GoaH 2.0.0 installation instructions

Just a quick document to get things started. More will follow. See README
for more details.


ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS
============================
I've written and tested the code with both Debian Etch and Debian Lenny, but
there's no reason why the software wouldn't run with any GNU/Linux distribution.

Currently installation requires some technical skills, but we'll be more than
glad to help you out on our forums.

Basic system installation requires (either program or Debian package name):
- Apache2 (others will do)
- Perl
- texlive-latex-base
- texlive-latex-recommended


PERL CPAN REQUIREMENTS
======================
These (and maybe some other) CPAN -modules are required by current version.
Install modules via whatever suits your environment. We'll create something more
useful later on, but now you'll have to satisfy with this ;)

Most of these packages can be found via offical Debian 5.0 repositories and I've
built some of them for my own use, you can find these packages from
http://take.nerd.fi/goah. My packages are totally unoffical so treat them properly.

Required CPAN modules:
- CGI
- Switch
- Encode
- Locale::Textdomain
- POSIX
- Class::DBI
- Class::DBI::Plugin::RetrieveAll
- Class::DBI::AbstractSearch
- Digest::MD5
- Template::Latex


INSTALLATION
============
Download the code, make sure every .cgi -file is executable and alter Apache
configuration so that ExecCGI is enabled. Then make sure that goah/db -directory
is fully writable (with files) by the apache-user. That's pretty much it. The
data in current database contains an user with l/p demo / demo.
